# Caesar_Cipher

The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.

E_n(x)=(x+n)mod\ 26 (Encryption Phase with shift n)

D_n(x)=(x-n)mod\ 26 (Decryption Phase with shift n)
